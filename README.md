Welcome to the worl of Python! 
-----------------------------------------------------

In this tutorial, we hope to learn more on how to start programming using python. There are lots of stuff you can do with this knowledge like web development, scripting, data processing and more!

If you have questions, please don't hesitate to ask and participate. You can also use the [Issues tab](https://github.com/pprmint/python-sample/issues) on github to ask questions about the code in any of the exercises.


## Getting started
We need python first!

Open your terminal or command prompt.
- For windows users, search for `cmd`
- For linux and mac users, search for `terminal`

After opening the terminal/command prompt, type the following command.
```shell
python --version
```

This will tell you what version of python is currently installed in your computer.

```shell
Python 3.6.0
```


We will be using `python 3.6` for this tutorial. You can download the [installer here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

For more detailed installation process, please [use this tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/python_installation/)

> If python 3.6 is already installed, no need to download the installer.

Once download is complete, run the installer and follow the steps. Done! You can now start coding in python!

## Let's do some warm up

Now we will do some very basic python program. `Hello WomenWhoCode!`

#### Clone or Download this repository

If you have previous experience in using github, just clone this repository by running 
```git
git clone https://github.com/pprmint/python-sample.git
```

For those who don't have experience in using github, do the following.
- Download the source code using this [DOWNLOAD LINK](https://github.com/pprmint/python-sample/archive/master.zip)
- Extract the source code to your preferred directory

#### Running your first Python program

Let's try to run some code.
- Open a terminal
- Go to the directory of the repository by running the following command.
```
cd <path_to_repo>/python-sample/exercises
```
- You should see a file called `first_python_code.py`. This is your simple program that prints some text.
- Run it by typing the following command.
```
python first_python_code.py
```
- The output should be
```
Hello WomanWhoCode!
Hello WomanWhoCode!
Hello WomanWhoCode!
```
- Open the file using your text editor to see the code.

#### Try printing your name
- Inside the file, there is an instruction. Follow it! :)
- When you are done, save the file and go back to the terminal
```
python first_python_code.py
```

Now you have run your first program! Please see detailed instructions on other exerciese <put link here>
