Welcome to the worl of Python! 
-----------------------------------------------------

In this tutorial, we hope to learn more on how to start programming using python. There are lots of stuff you can do with this knowledge like web development, scripting, data processing and more!

If you have questions, please don't hesitate to ask and participate. You can also use the [Issues tab](https://github.com/pprmint/python-sample/issues) on github to ask questions about the code in any of the exercises.


## Getting started
We need python first!

Open your terminal or command prompt.
- For windows users, search for `cmd`
- For linux and mac users, search for `terminal`

After opening the terminal/command prompt, type the following command.
```shell
python --version
```

This will tell you what version of python is currently installed in your computer.

```shell
Python 3.6.0
```


We will be using `python 3.6` for this tutorial. You can download the [installer here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

For more detailed installation process, please [use this tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/python_installation/)

> If python 3.6 is already installed, no need to download the installer.

Once download is complete, run the installer and follow the steps. Done! You can now start coding in python!

## Let's do some warm up

Now we will do some very basic python program. `Hello WomenWhoCode!`
