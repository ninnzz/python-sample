### Welcome to the worl of Python! 

In this tutorial, we hope to learn more on how to start programming using python. There are lots of stuff you can do with this knowledge like web development, scripting, data processing and more!

If you have questions, please don't hesitate to ask and participate. You can also use the [Issues tab](https://github.com/pprmint/python-sample/issues) on github to ask questions about the code in any of the exercises.


#### Getting started
We need python first!

Open your terminal or command prompt.
- For windows users, search for `cmd`
- For linux and mac users, search for `terminal`

After opening the terminal/command prompt, type the following command.
```python
python --version
```

This will tell you what version of python is currently installed in your computer.

For this tutorial, we will be using `python 3.6`, the latest version. You can download the [installer here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

For more detailed installation process, please [use this tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/python_installation/)

If python 3.6 is already installed, no need to download the installer.

Once download is complete, run the installer and follow the steps. Done! You can now start coding in python!

#### Let's do some warm up

Now we will do some very basic python program. `Hello WomenWhoCode!`

Open a text editor or any text editing software in your computer. Notepad ++ or Sublime or PyCharm. For beginners, we recommend installing Sublime as it is good for development purposes. You can download Sublime [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)

When you have your text editor open, create a new file and copy the following line of code.

```python

# Basic example on how to print
# text using different approach in
# Python.

organization = 'WomanWhoCode!'

# You can print it right away!
print('Hello WomanWhoCode!')

# Example of string concatenation
print('Hello ' + organization)

# Using .format() function to attach a string
print('Hello {}'.format(organization))
```

Save the file and name it `women_who_code.py`.

Open a terminal, go to the derectory
